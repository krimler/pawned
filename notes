Linux mount things:
Volume Configuration
Volume scheduled for creation.

To get started with a new volume, you'll want to create a filesystem on it:

Create a Filesystem
mkfs.ext4 "/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Linode_Volume_foodisk"

Once the volume has a filesystem, you can create a mountpoint for it:

Create a Mountpoint
mkdir "/mnt/foodisk"

Then you can mount the new volume:

Mount Volume
mount "/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Linode_Volume_foodisk" "/mnt/foodisk"

If you want the volume to automatically mount every time your Linode boots, you'll want to add a line like the following to your /etc/fstab file:

Mount every time your Linode boots
/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0Linode_Volume_foodisk /mnt/foodisk ext4 defaults,noatime,nofail 0 2
